State is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change the behavior when its internal state changes.
The pattern extracts state-related behaviors into separate state classes and forces the original object to delegate the work to an instance of these classes, instead of acting on its own.

Usage of the pattern in Java
Complexity: easy
Popularity: medium

Usage examples: The State pattern is commonly used in Java to convert massive switch-base state machines into objects.
Here are some examples of the State pattern in core Java libraries:
-> javax.faces.lifecycle.LifeCycle#execute() (controlled by the FacesServlet: behavior is dependent on current phase (state) of JSF lifecycle)

Identification:
The State pattern can be recognized by methods that change their behavior depending on the objectsâ€™ state.
You can confirm identification if you see that this state can be controlled or replaced by other objects, including state objects themselves.

Code example: Interface of a media player
In this example, the State pattern lets the same media player controls behave differently, depending on the current playback state.
The main class of the player contains a reference to a state object, which performs most of the work for the player.
Some actions may end-up replacing the state object with another, which changes the way the player reacts to the user interactions.
